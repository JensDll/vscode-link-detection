# Getting Started

1. Clone this repository
2. Run `pnpm install`
3. Press `F5` to start debugging
4. Open either the [`playground`](https://github.com/JensDll/vscode-link-detection/tree/main/playground) folder of this repository or something else

This example extension adds file system link detection, as is seen in `.log` files or the VS Code integrated terminal through the [`DocumentLinkProvider`](https://code.visualstudio.com/api/references/vscode-api#DocumentLinkProvider) interface (but only for Unix paths). A reference repository for https://github.com/microsoft/vscode/issues/169025.
